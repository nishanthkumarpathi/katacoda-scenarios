List is an ordered sequence of items. It is one of the most used datatype in Python and is very flexible. 

All the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.

Declaring a list is pretty straight forward. Items separated by commas are enclosed within brackets `[ ]`

`a = [1, 2.2, 'python']`{{execute}}

`print(a)`{{execute}}

We can use the slicing operator [ ] to extract an item or a range of items from a list. 

The index starts from 0 in Python.

`a = [5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40]`{{execute}}

### a[2] = 15

`print("a[2] = ", a[2])`{{execute}}

# a[0:3] = [5, 10, 15]

`print("a[0:3] = ", a[0:3])`{{execute}}

# a[5:] = [30, 35, 40]

`print("a[5:] = ", a[5:])`{{execute}}
